Configuration for raspberry pi zero.
The configuration is so that we can connect the pi to our chosen Access Point on boot.

First we will need to confirgure the interfaces located at: /etc/network/interfaces.txt

Change the first line to: "auto wlan0"
than at the very bottom, add lines telling the pi to use the wpa_supplicant configuration file to connect to the wifi ap.

-------------------------------------------------
allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp (or static)
[static address configuration here]
wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
iface default inet dhcp (or static)
-------------------------------------------------

If you need a static address when connecting the pi to the wifi, add these lines before the wpa-conf line:
--------------------------------------------
address 192.168.6.66 <-- static ip you want
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.x.x <-- Ip of router
--------------------------------------------

Next comes the configuration of the wpa_supplicant file.
We have to change directory to: /etc/wpa_supplcant
If there is no wpa.conf file, make one and rename it as wpa_supplicant.
The following configuration is only for the conf file.

network={
ssid="network-name"
psk="network-pass"
proto=RSN
key-mgmt=WPA-PSK
pairwise=CCMP
auth_alg=OPEN
}

+proto= RSN(WPA2) or WPA (WPA1)
+key_mgmt= WPA-PSK(normal) or WPA-EAP(Enterprise network)
+pairwise= CCMP(WPA2) or TKIP (WPA1)
+auth_alg= mostly OPEN, or LEAP & SHARED

==== ArchLinux configuration for pi =====


The following applies for the standard wireless connections using a pre-shared key (WPA-PSK).

/etc/netctl/wireless-wpa
