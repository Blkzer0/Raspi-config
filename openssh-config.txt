Install OpenSSH Server

To communicate with our Raspberry Pi from a computer or phone, we'll need to be able to log in. To do so, we can use SSH to connect via any Wi-Fi connection we share with the Pi. SSH, or the Secure Shell, is a network protocol that allows us to run commands remotely on a device. This means we don't need to plug in a screen to interact with our Pi.

In a terminal, run the following to install openSSH server and update the runlevels to allow SSH to start on boot:

    apt-get install openssh-server
    update-rc.d -f ssh remove
    update-rc.d -f ssh defaults

The default keys represent a huge vulnerability since anyone can guess them. Let's change them immediately by running the following commands:

    cd /etc/ssh/
    mkdir insecure_old
    mv ssh_host* insecure_old
    dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server

This backs up the old SSH keys in another folder and generates new keys. Problem solved! Now let's make sure we can log in via root by typing:

    nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

This will open your SSH configuration folder. Change this line:

    PermitRootLogin without-password

To this line instead:

    PermitRootLogin yes

And type Ctrl O to save the changes. If it already is correct, you don't need to change anything.
Great! Let's restart the SSH service by typing:

    sudo service ssh restart
    update-rc.d -f ssh enable 2 3 4 5

Finally, to test that we've got SSH working, use the following to see if SSH is currently running.

    sudo service ssh status

If it's not, run this to get it going:

    sudo service ssh start

If you find SSH doesn't work, you can use raspi-config as a workaround. 
It's meant for Jessie, but it'll work on Kali, too. 
To use it, first clone from GitHub, type sudo mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /boot to mount the boot partition, cd to the directory, 
and run sudo bash raspi-config.
